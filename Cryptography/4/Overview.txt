Imports: Libraries for cryptography, data encoding, compression, and randomness.

Constants: Establishing parameters for message encryption and integrity checks.

Functions: A series of helper functions for encryption and data manipulation:

XOR Operation: Performs an XOR operation on the message and key.
Random Byte Generation: Generates random bytes of specified length for keys.
Character Encoding: Encodes the message using a specific encoding scheme.
Base32 Encoding: Encodes data in Base32 format.
Data Compression: Compresses the encrypted data for efficiency.
Integrity Hash Generation: Computes a SHA-256 hash for integrity verification.
Verification Token Generation: Creates a random verification token.

Classes:
None: Like the previous challenges, this one utilizes standalone functions.
Example Usage: Demonstrates how to input a message, encrypt it, and retrieve keys and verificationÂ codes.
