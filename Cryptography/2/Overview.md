Overview:
This encryption challenge simulates concepts from quantum cryptography using obfuscated Python code. The challenge revolves around quantum entanglement, quantum circuits, and quantum key distribution. Participants are tasked with analyzing the obfuscated functions and recovering the hidden flag.

The cryptography elements like AES encryption, random quantum states, and key generation are integrated to simulate a quantum encryption algorithm. Below is the breakdown of the encryption script.

# This function simulates quantum entanglement by performing a simple XOR operation on the input string.
def _0x6D6D(s): 
    return ''.join(chr(ord(c)^0x2A) for c in s)
Quantum Entanglement Simulation (_0x6D6D):
This function takes a string s and returns a new string where each character is XORed with a constant value (42). This operation simulates the change of quantum states due to entanglement.

# This function simulates a quantum circuit, generating a sequence of quantum bits (qubits).
def _0x7E7E():
    # Lambda function generates random qubits (0 or 1).
    _0x8F8F = lambda: chr(_0x1337.randint(48, 49))  
    # Generate a list of 5 qubits.
    _0x9G9G = [_0x8F8F() for _ in range(5)]  
    
    # List of lambda functions simulating quantum gates applied on the qubits.
    _0xA1A1 = [
        lambda x: x,                   # Identity gate (does nothing)
        lambda x: _0x9G9G[0],          # Apply first qubit to all positions
        lambda x: chr(97-ord(x)),      # Custom transformation
        lambda x: _0x8F8F(),           # Generate new random qubit
        lambda x: x                    # Identity gate (does nothing)
    ]
    
    # Return the result of applying quantum gates on the generated qubits.
    return ''.join(_0xA1A1[i](_0x9G9G[i]) for i in range(5))
Quantum Circuit Simulator (_0x7E7E):
Generates a sequence of random qubits (binary values) and applies quantum gates (defined as lambda functions) to simulate operations on the qubits.
This simulates a quantum computation with random transformations applied to the qubit state.

# Quantum key distribution protocol using a SHA-256 hash to create a symmetric key.
def _0xB2B2(_0xC3C3):
    # Hash the input using SHA-256.
    _0xD4D4 = _0x3A3A.sha256(_0xC3C3.encode()).digest()  
    # XOR the first 16 bytes with the last 16 bytes to create a 128-bit key.
    return bytes(a^b for a,b in zip(_0xD4D4[:16], _0xD4D4[16:]))
Quantum Key Distribution (_0xB2B2):
This function implements a simple quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. It uses the SHA-256 hash of the quantum state and XORs the first half of the hash with the second half to derive a symmetric encryption key.

# Quantum encryption algorithm using AES encryption.
def _0xE5E5(_0xF6F6):
    # Generate a random 16-byte initialization vector (IV).
    _0x1010 = bytes([_0x1337.randint(0, 255) for _ in range(16)])  
    # Create a new AES cipher object using the key and IV in CBC mode.
    _0x1111 = _0x4B4B.new(_0xF6F6, _0x4B4B.MODE_CBC, _0x1010)  
    # Apply quantum entanglement to the secret message (flag) and pad it to the block size.
    _0x1212 = _0x6D6D("DJSISACA{Qub1ts_Unl34sh3d_fr0m_th3_F0rg0tt3n_B4se}").encode()
    # Encrypt the padded message and encode the IV and ciphertext using base85 encoding.
    return _0x2A2A.b85encode(_0x1010 + _0x1111.encrypt(_0x5C5C(_0x1212, 16))).decode()
Quantum Encryption Algorithm (_0xE5E5):
Encrypts the flag using AES with a random 16-byte initialization vector (IV) and the symmetric key generated from the QKD protocol.
The flag is transformed using quantum entanglement before encryption and then padded for AES.
The final encrypted message (IV + ciphertext) is encoded using Base85.

# Step 1: Generate a quantum state by simulating a quantum circuit.
_0x1313 = _0x7E7E()
# Step 2: Create a quantum key using the QKD protocol with the generated quantum state.
_0x1414 = _0xB2B2(_0x1313)
# Step 3: Encrypt the flag using the generated key.
_0x1515 = _0xE5E5(_0x1414)

# Print the simulated quantum circuit output and the encrypted flag.
print(f"{_0x6D6D('Simulated Quantum Circuit Output')}: {_0x1313}")
print(f"{_0x6D6D('Encrypted Flag')}: {_0x1515}")
Main Encryption Process:
A quantum state is generated by simulating a quantum circuit.
A quantum key is derived using the QKD protocol based on the generated quantum state.
The flag is encrypted using AES with the derived quantum key, and the result is printed.
Important Notes:
Quantum Entanglement: The XOR operation simulates the changes in quantum states.
Quantum Circuit Simulation: The qubit transformations simulate real-world quantum gates.
Quantum Key Distribution: A SHA-256 hash is used to mimic the secure distribution of a quantum key.
AES Encryption: The AES algorithm encrypts the flag in CBC mode, ensuring secure encryption.
