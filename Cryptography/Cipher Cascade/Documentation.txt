Steps to solve this challenge

1) Identify the ciphers used 

Rot 10 --> lines 1,5,9...
Atbash Cipher --> lines 2,6,10...
Vigenère Cipher key=key --> lines 3,7,11...
Affine Cipher --> lines 4,8,12...

2) First separate out the same ciphers by the given script "split.py" 

3) For the first file use rot10 to decrypt the ciphers
   For the second use atbash cipher to decrypt 
   For the third use Vigenère cipher to decrypt using the key as "key"
   For the forth use affine cipher to decrypt 

4) Now use the script "concat.py" to again join deciphered sentences you will notice after the full stops (from line 27 to 66) of some lines you would get the flag vertically joining the letters you get the flag as: DJSISACA{mult1pl3_crypt0_d3crypt0_1==0?}
