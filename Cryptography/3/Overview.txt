Imports: Libraries for cryptographic hashing, random number generation, and encoding.

Constants: Setting up values for cryptographic operations and random number generation.

Functions: A series of helper functions for encryption and encoding:

SHA-256 Hashing: Generates a secure hash from input values.
Character Transformation: Modifies characters by a fixed offset.
Random Number Generation: Produces random numbers for encryption keys.
Message Encryption: Encrypts the input message using key values and cryptographic techniques.
Data Encoding: Encodes the encrypted message in a specific format.

Classes:
None: This challenge also uses standalone functions instead of classes.
Example Usage: Illustrates how to encrypt a message and generate verification codes, including displaying encrypted data and keys.
